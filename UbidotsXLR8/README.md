# UbidotsXLR8

This library enables communication with the Ubidots servers using an Alorium XLR8 family board and an ATWINC1500 WiFi breakout board.

To use Alorium XLR8 boards, please refer to our quickstart guide for [XLR8](http://www.aloriumtech.com/xlr8-quickstart/) or [Snō](http://www.aloriumtech.com/sno-quickstart/)

To use this library with your Alorium hardware, connect an Alorium XLR8 or Snō to a WINC1500 module by connecting the SPI interfaces together, CS to D8, IRQ to D7, and RST to D4.

To update the firmware of the ATWINC1500, please follow the [Adafruit firmware update guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-wifi-atwinc1500/updating-firmware)
